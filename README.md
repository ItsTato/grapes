# grapes
Grapes is a poorly-written, self-proclaimed "database" written entirely in Python 3.10 out of all things. You really shouldn't use this...

## Installing
**Grapes is currently not on pypi. You can NOT obtain it officially through pip.**

To install grapes just drag and drop the "grapes" folder into any project you want or add it to your `site_packages` folder for use over all of python.
