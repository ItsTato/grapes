# grapes
Grapes is a poorly-written, self-proclaimed "database" made entirely in Python 3.10 out of all languages...

## Installing
Look at [this wiki page](https://github.com/ItsTato/grapes/wiki/Installing#) for installation instructions.

## Current Project Goals
- **[ACHIEVED]** Each table will be a `.grape` file. Every table will be kept in the same folder structure of right now /`data`/`tables`/. At the root of the database folder (/`data`/) there will be a special `definition.bin` file ~~just like there is one for every table as of writing this~~. With this file all information about columns will be stored plus some meta database information. (such as `grapes` version, `Python` version, etc.)
- Get this shit on pypi (once it's finished (`v2.0.0`))
- Finish this thing (first release: `v2.0.0`)
- `CachedInMemoryGrapesDatabase()` class when?
