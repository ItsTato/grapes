# grapes
Grapes is a poorly-written, self-proclaimed "database" written entirely in Python 3.10 out of all things. You really shouldn't use this...

## Installing
**Grapes is currently not on pypi. You can NOT obtain it officially through pip.**

To install grapes just drag and drop the `grapes` folder into any project you want or add it to your `site_packages` folder for use over all of python.

## Current Project Goals
- Use a single .grape file for the entire database. This file should be in binary (pickle) and would ideally help reduce any lag that may be experienced from the host operating system's file system.
