# grapes
Grapes is a poorly-written, self-proclaimed "database" written entirely in Python 3.10 out of all things. You really shouldn't use this...

## Installing
**Grapes is currently not on pypi. You can NOT obtain it officially through pip.**

To install grapes just drag and drop the `grapes` folder into any project you want or add it to your `site_packages` folder for use over all of python.

## Current Project Goals
- Each table will be a `.grape` file. Every table will be kept in the same folder structure of right now /`data`/`tables`/. At the root of the database folder (/`data`/) there will be a special `definition.bin` file ~~just like there is one for every table as of writing this~~. With this file all information about columns will be stored plus some meta database information. (such as *grapes* version, *Python* version, etc.)

## Project Roadmap
